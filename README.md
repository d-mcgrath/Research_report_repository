# Research_report_repository
A repository of scripts used for the analysis done within the research report.

# Project overview
This repository contains various scripts used for the analysis done in the research report.

# Bash scripts
Bash scripts written for some of the analysis were run on the WHOI Poseidon High Performance Computing cluster. These scripts and their annotations can be found in the /bash_scripts folder.

# Python script
A custom python script was used to concatenate all individual read count text files into a single file in a matrix format, for downstream analysis using DESeq2 in R.This script can be found in the /python_scripts folder.

# R scripts
R was used for the differential expression analysis and figure creation. Two annotated scripts used for this analysis can be found in the /R_scripts folder.

# Custom gene reference sequences
Custom sequences which were used to blast against all gene annotations generated from InterProScan are available in the gene-query-seqs folder.
